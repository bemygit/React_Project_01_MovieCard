#React web application using vite framework
This minimal application provides a core concepts;
  - Great understanding of properties(props) --> accessing the data from one component to another component.
  - All data is created in object format and used them accurately in a component --> it takes lesser time rather than design each and every component one by one.
  - Map function --> for every instance of object, it calls the component, reduces the work by creating and editing the component card one by one.
  - Handle state and setState in a project effeciently --> which helps in change the UI considering conditional rendering
  - Learned about startesWith() method and implemented in this project
